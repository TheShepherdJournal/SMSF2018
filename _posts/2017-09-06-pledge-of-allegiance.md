SMS 8th grade students, Paige Walters and Hanna Hamilton, were nominated this week by Mr. Ferency to recite the Pledge of Allegiance during morning announcements. We are proud of our student leadership at SMS and want to recognize these two girls for stepping up and making a difference. There's no better time than now to be a Blue Jay!!
