<p>Come and enjoy the fun as you eat as many pancakes as you can in eight minutes!  Prizes awarded to all who enter the contest.</p>
<p>The Pancake Eating Contest will be held on Sunday, April 29, 2018 at 9 a.m. as a part of the 2018 Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. The contest will take place under a tent in front of the Shepherd High School. In the case of bad weather, it will be moved into the high school cafeteria.</p>
<p>There is no cost to enter the contest.</p>
<p>Volunteers will be needed to help transport pancakes to the event, and then help with clean up.</p>
