<h2>Remembering 9/11</h2>
In honor of the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attack, I wanted to share a couple of questions with everybody:
<ol>
 	<li>Where were you when you found out about the events of September 11, 2001?</li>
 	<li>Also, what stands out the most in your memory of that day?</li>
</ol>
I was home that morning with my wife and then one-year-old daughter. The TV was on and tuned to the "Today Show." I remember that at first they were reporting on a fire in the Trade Center, and rumors that a small plane had crashed into it.

The discussion became more concerned as the fire continued, but more speculative as they tried to figure out what had happened and how.

Then, just as they were talking an airliner jet appeared in frame and inside just a few seconds crashed into the south tower.

My wife and were glued to the TV for the rest of the morning.

Here is a link to the article about 9/11 on Wikipedia.
