Things will start to get busy as we get closer to the start of the Festival. Today is the first day that many garage sales around the Shepherd area will open.

The <a href="https://shepherdmaplesyrupfest.wordpress.com/2016/04/15/flea-market/">Flea Market</a> will open up for its first day on the North side of town at 10 a.m. and stay opened until 7 p.m. This new festival event will feature lots of different vendors.

Pony Rides will also be available in downtown Shepherd.

Tonight at 5 p.m. the Carnival open up for its first night. Tonight is Buddy Night, when wristbands are two for $20 when you bring a friend.
