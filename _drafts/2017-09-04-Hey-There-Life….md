<p>Hey There Life…</p>
<p>You have given me a chance, a unique opportunity... and I am so very grateful for it...
I finished up my summer speaking this last week and was reflecting on where I had been, the people I had met, and what I had learned…</p>
<p>Life... I was smiling the entire time... getting to hang out with Dorothy Sagorski VanderJagt... Ben Gilpin... and all of the others who made me so very welcome in their states, their schools, and even their homes is an amazing feeling Life…</p>
<p>But the best part? Starting to feel like maybe I am making a difference with the speaking... this summer got better and better and the feedback kept coming…</p>
<p>I saw heads nodding and shaking... laughter from audiences, and even tears as educators realized along with me this profession is a gift... a very special one... oh and the hugs afterwards... well could be the best part!</p>
<p>And the notes/messages/tweets was icing on the cake for me... filling my heart knowing I had touched someone else's…</p>
<p>But on the final day Life... at La Salle High School and the Eastern UP District PD... well I was allowed a feeling beyond description…</p>
<p>At the end of my keynote I watched as 350+ educators went to their feet for a standing ovation that felt two days long... and when the ISD Superintendent walked toward me smiling and whispered to me, "they don't stand for just anyone"...</p>
<p>The lump in my throat about choked me... I left with a heart so full and a smile so wide...
I wish I could hug Kevin Honeycutt, Ginger Lewman, and Brenda Druecker for taking a chance on me years ago…</p>
<p>They were right Life... I can make a difference…</p>
<p>I just had to believe…</p>
