<p>As part of the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival, competitors will put their bellies to the test on Sunday, April 30 at 9 a.m. when they compete in the Pancake Eating Contest under the tent in front of Shepherd High School. Adam McCann of Midland was the winner last year by eating 15 </p>
<p>pancakes in eight minutes. We heard that there will be “royalty representation” at this fun event, so it is one you won’t want to miss!</p>

<p>“Everyone is welcome,” says event coordinator Kathy Shepard. “The only thing participants need to bring is an appetite for fresh, hot-off-the-grill pancakes.”</p>
