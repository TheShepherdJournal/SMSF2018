WHY I LOVE BEING A CROSSING GUARD: “I love seeing the kids smiling faces and the occasional hugs!”
WORDS OF ADVICE FOR STUDENTS/PARENTS: “It is important for the students to stay on the curb until I tell them that it is okay to step off. If they ride a bicycle to school I want them to push it across the road.”
