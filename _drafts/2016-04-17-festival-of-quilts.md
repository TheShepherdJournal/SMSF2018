The Festival of Quilts will be held inside the Shepherd Middle School Gymnasium on Saturday, April 23. The public is invited to view the quilts from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.<!--more-->Community members have contributed <span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">quilts, wall hangings, runners and/or mini-quilts for visitors to enjoy.  These could  be recently completed works by local quilters  or have been family heirlooms for generations.  The stories that  accompany each quilt are always interesting to read.  This is not a judged show but a sharing of handmade items for the pleasure of  all viewers.</span>

The quilts will be dropped off at the Middle School Gym on Friday, April 22 from 5 to 7 p.m.
