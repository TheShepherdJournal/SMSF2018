<blockquote>Michigan’s Family Funnyman™, Joel Tacey, will delight and engage the audience with his variety show. See Joel perform goofy stunts, amazing magic, dazzle with juggling, make wacky music and so much more. Don’t miss the chance to enjoy, or be a part of, Joel’s zany antics. The fun begins at 4 p.m. or immediately following the Maple Syrup Festival Parade.</blockquote>
