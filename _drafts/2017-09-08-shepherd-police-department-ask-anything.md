<h2>Shepherd Police Department Ask Anything</h2>
<h3>Tuesday, September 5, 2017</h3>
Good morning everyone! It's that time of the week, ASK ANYTHING TUESDAY!!! This is your opportunity to ask any law enforcement related questions...READY...SET...GO…
<h4>Q:</h4>
I live on shepherd Rd, very busy all the time. My neighbors have children that I would say range from age 11 to probably 13. I see them driving a four wheeler and a ATV down the wrong side of the Rd and it scares me because people drive so fast on this Rd. Is it leagal to drive 4 wheelers, golf carts, and ATV on the road north of mission?
<h5>Shepherd Police Department (SPD):</h5>
Yes, with some restrictions. There is the county ORV Ordinance; <a href="http://www.isabellacounty.org/.../Isabella_ORV_Ordinance.pdf">http://www.isabellacounty.org/.../Isabella_ORV_Ordinance.pdf</a>
<h4>Q:</h4>
When lights are not on or flashing. Do police have to abide by same laws as other vehicles. Like running stop signs l, speeding,
<h5>SPD:</h5>
If no lights/sirens must abide by regular traffic laws.
<h4>Q:</h4>
Is there a speed limit under 55 for dirt roads? I am so sick of people thinking that E. Pleasant Valley off of Federal is a race track. I feel that even 55 is too fast for dirt roads. Our road is terribly crazy with fast drivers and also semi trucks that just blow by. And people wonder why my child doesn't play outside.
<h5>SPD:</h5>
55 is the speed limit, unless otherwise marked. Those speed limits are set by the state.
<h4>Q:</h4>
ok since school is back here is one I have never figured out. When a school bus is on a 5 lane road like M20 going towards Midland stopping and your across all 5 lanes going the opposite direction are you stopping? Because no one ever does and this is confusing.
<h5>SPD:</h5>
Here is a diagram

<h4>Q:</h4>
When it comes to those roundabouts. Who goes first. Is it the same as a four way intersection
<h5>SPD:</h5>
Roundabouts are easy to navigate and safer than traditional intersections. Remember, traffic in the roundabout always moves counterclockwise.

Choose your lane before entering.
Yield to traffic already in the roundabout.
Yield to pedestrians in crosswalks.
Use signs and pavement markings to help guide you.

<h4>Q:</h4>
Why aren't more people pulled over and ticketed for driving too slow? People don't have the patience for drivers like that and so therefore it becomes dangerous to everyone on the road when someone isn't at least doing the speed limit....
<h5>SPD:</h5>
Lack of patience is the key. Unless they are on the highway, there is no minimum speed
<h5>Q:</h5>
People might think Im crazy for asking this but can horse's be rode in shepherd? Ive never seen any before other than maybe parades. I always think about bringing mine to town but wasnt sure?
<h5>SPD:</h5>
Not crazy at all, actually someone asked the same question a few months ago. Yes, must follow all the laws of the road. Obviously we ask that if they have any "issues" that is cleaned up too.
<h4>Q:</h4>
If I am pulling out of lets say Meijer, and I pull into the turn lane to make my way to the driving lane. Stopped or still moving. What is illegal? What is the proper way to use the center turn lane coming from a parking lot, if at all.
<h5>SPD:</h5>
By law yes. The MMUTCD (Michigan Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Device) is applied to Michigan law in of a section in the Michigan Vehicle Code. It states that a center turn lane is only for preparing to make a left turn.

Drivers who use it for accelerating and merging are breaking the law and creating a high risk of a head-on collision. Michigan law says that you may enter the center turn lanes at a “reasonable” distance from your left turn. “Reasonable” distance is determined by traffic conditions and other circumstances at the time.
<h4>Q:</h4>
What's the laws of openly carrying hunting/survival knives? From what I'm understanding it can not be carried unless it is on private property, or if it clearly being used for the aid of hunting.
<h5>SPD:</h5>
The MI knife law can be confusing. Your understanding is fairly correct. The law also speaks of the persons intent, so using it for work would not be an ill intent. Check out the link below for more information <a href="https://www.akti.org/state-knife-laws/michigan/">https://www.akti.org/state-knife-laws/michigan/</a>
<h4>Q:</h4>
Why don't we hear about people getting a ticket for tailgating? Since I was in an accident and rear ended at a stop it really upsets me to be tail gated and makes me wonder why more tickets aren't given out for this? More an issue on m46 and paved back roads than in town but still makes me wonder.
<h5>SPD:</h5>
The officer needs to view it to issue it. If nobody is there to see it...there isn't much that can be done. The worst idea is when people "brakecheck" or slam on their brakes...very dangerous for all involved.
