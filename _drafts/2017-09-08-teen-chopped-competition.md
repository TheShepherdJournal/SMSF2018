Michigan State University Extension office announces a change in the Teen "Chopped " Competition.

This event has been reschedule and will take place on November 4th.

The deadline for applying is 9/25, there is a meeting on 10/10, and the event is 11/4. This year we have trained chefs that will consult with the teams, which is something new. There is a cash prize for the overall winner, and also prizes for Best Presentation and Most Creative. It was a really positive experience last year, and we are hoping to showcase the talent of area youth.

Please contact MSU Extension Office at 989-317-4079 or email <a href="mailto:lynchka4@anr.msu.edu">lynchka4@anr.msu.edu</a>.
