The Maple Syrup Festival has selected Max Augustine to be Grand Marshal of the 2016 Maple Syrup Festival Parade to be presented Sunday, April 24th, 2:30 pm in ‘downtown’ Shepherd.  The theme of this year’s parade, Our Heritage,  celebrates the 58 years  the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival has taken place on the last full weekend in April.  It is very appropriate then that Max Augustine, a founding member of the Festival, leads the parade.<!--more-->

<p id="h.gjdgxs">Max was born November 8, 1926 and raised in nearby St. Louis.  His education at St. Louis High School was interrupted, however, when he enlisted in the United States Navy in 1944 as a seventeen year old boy.  Max served aboard the USS Seminole, a transport ship that moved men and materials in the Pacific Ocean to various strategic locations.  Sailing toward the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in June of 1946 has been a happy memory for Max, signaling the end of his service and return home.  How then did Max and other veterans earn their high school diplomas?  For Max, St. Louis High School offered a special class in which he studied the subjects he had missed independently in the principal’s office.  A search for a job ended with employment at the Shepherd State Bank, thus bringing Max Augustine to Shepherd.</p>

On May 20, 1950 Max married Patricia, an Alma girl, and a soon-to-be University of Michigan Nursing School graduate.  Pat nursed at the Alma Hospital for seventeen years and then became an Alma Public Schools counselor.  Their family includes Randy Augustine of  Newnan, Georgia, Gail and Ken Turnwald of Lake Isabella (Mrs. Turnwald to hundreds of Shepherd Middle School students), Bryan (has never missed a Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival!) and Ellen Cooper from Rockford, and Cathleen  and Andy Klakulak of Yuma, Arizona.  Max also enjoys his 10 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. Sadly, Pat passed away in 2006.

Recalling the first years of the Shepherd Sugar Bush Corporation (planning in 1958-producing in spring 1959), Max remembers the garage, which had been located behind the post office, being donated and moved north to the present site of the DPW building to be used as the ‘sugar house’.  Another building, a log cabin from the St. Louis area, was moved to the present flag pole location and used as a meeting place for the planners of the Sugar Bush Corporation.  Nearly a thousand pails were brought from the Gerber Baby Food Factory and taken to Rhynard’s Garage where they were power-washed.  As tapping time came, a truck carrying the pails drove the street and workers threw off the appropriate number of pails for the newly tapped Maples.  Can you imagine the excitement of getting this operation underway?  $100 loans were made by local businesses to purchase the necessary equipment and Max wonders whether those loans were ever paid off?!  Over those early years Max and others contributed in a variety of ways from cutting wood, gathering sap, running the evaporator to canning the syrup into ‘half-gallons’.  The first year 249 half-gallons were made and dinners were held in two different sites serving pancakes, sausage, and  hoped-to-be famous Shepherd Maple Syrup.

Max stressed that the plans coming out of that old log cabin emphasized profits from the Shepherd Sugar Bush Corporation (with the Maple Syrup Festival organizing later) were always to be used for community recreation.  And those are the guidelines under which thousands of volunteers have continued to work in the following years, with a bow to Our Heritage and founders like Max Augustine and others.  Thank you, Max.
