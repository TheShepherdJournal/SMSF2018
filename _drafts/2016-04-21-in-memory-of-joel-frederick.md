I wanted to take a moment this week to acknowledge Joel Frederick’s contribution to the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival’s website over the last few years. We began working together on the website about six years ago, but we had been friends before then. We complemented each other with our individual talents, but I always knew that we shared a passion for web design and a desire to support our community. Each year we would meet to talk about the upcoming festival and bounce ideas off of each other on the areas where we could improve the website.<!--more-->

I called Joel in mid December on the way home from work to ask him about when we might be able to meet to discuss the website. He told me that he had been working on a new upgrade for the homepage which was going to introduce a carousel of photos and featured articles which would slide across the top of the page. There were some other improvements, also that were almost complete. We set a time when we would meet on the following Tuesday. We also talked about some other things, and then said good-bye.

Joel passed away that weekend. He left some pretty big shoes to fill when it comes to maintaining the website, but I’ve done my best to figure things out and do as much as I could. The toughest part was to continue an annual routine of article updates and pre-festival planning that Joel had been such a huge part of.

Anybody who knew Joel is welcome to respond in the comments with some thoughts, or feel free to share a few words about someone in your life who has passed away over the last year.
