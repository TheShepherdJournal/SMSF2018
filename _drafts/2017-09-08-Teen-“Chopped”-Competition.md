<p>Michigan State University Extension office announces a change in the Teen "Chopped " Competition.</p>
<p>This event has been reschedule and will take place on November 4th.</p>
<p>The deadline for applying is 9/25, there is a meeting on 10/10, and the event is 11/4. This year we have trained chefs that will consult with the teams, which is something new. There is a cash prize for the overall winner, and also prizes for Best Presentation and Most Creative. It was a really positive experience last year, and we are hoping to showcase the talent of area youth.</p>
