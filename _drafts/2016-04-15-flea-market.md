<p id="h.n9ifdfwutug1"><strong>Location:</strong> Soccer Field on the north end of town</p>

<strong> April 21 - 23</strong>
<strong>Thursday, Friday and Saturday</strong>
<strong>10 a.m. - 7 p.m.</strong>

The flea market will consist of a huge collection of vendors, crafts, and distributors of a wide variety of goods.  There are 40 booths, with no 2 booths offering the same products, so you’ll be sure to find that special treasure or gift.<!--more-->

We offer a Mini- Quarter Mania on Saturday at 1 P.M.  At this time customers will have the chance to bid on prizes from the vendors for .25 cents or 5/ $1.00.  The winner of each drawing will receive an item worth at least $15 in value.  This is a fun way to spend an hour of your day and a chance to go home with some great prizes.

Vendors on the Run is made up of local, small business owners and crafters who work together to market their goods. We welcome new comers and are taking applications.
