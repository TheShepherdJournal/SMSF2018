<p id="h.fkpfoj8dlps8">Garage sales are typically run independently, so there isn’t an official start date. However, they do tend to start to open around Wednesday and then go all of the way into Saturday, with some staying open until Sunday.</p>

There is a group on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/SMSFgaragesales/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460854587288000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYD3hJt3jat_Ho948j-X6_r_W-Pg">Facebook where you can find out more information</a>. Jeff Parsons, the group admin, will usually collect information from garage sales operators up until the start of the festival, and share that list with garage salers.

He says that he will update the index of garage sales nightly, and then as the festival gets closer he will publish a downloadable PDF. It’s best to join the group and watch for updates, or to watch for updates on the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival page.
