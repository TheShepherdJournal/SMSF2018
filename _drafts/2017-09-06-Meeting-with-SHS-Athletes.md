<h2>Meeting with SHS Athletes</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Today I had a chance to speak to our fall Shepherd High School athletes. We talked about expectations, choices and consequences. I also reminded them that on and off the field/court/course they are not just representing themselves, they are representing their family, friends, school and every little kid that looks up to them as a hero. I remember when high school athletes would come visit us in elementary school and it was amazing, almost like they were pros. It was a great talk and I expect great things on and off the playing field.</p>
